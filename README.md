## Hi there 👋
- 👨‍💻 I am a full stack software engineer @ [Golden Hearts Games](https://goldenheartsgames.com/).
- 🐍 My favorite stack is Django(REST Framework), React & PostgreSQL.
- 🎹 I am a custom keyboard geek. My current obsession is a 40% [Corne (CRKBD)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) running [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
- 🛶 When I am not writing or learning about code, I am whitewater kayaking.
- 🪂 Fun fact: Before writing code for a living, I was a professional skydiver!
